## Q & A

is this a complete game?
*no it has a fully playable first objective and alot of the core mechanics are done but there is much to do!*

why are you making this open source?
*the truth is i'll probably never "finnish" this game. It would be nice but making games is very time consumeing so i'm hoping that by making this open source it will both be a learning experience for some and hopefully an opportunity to further develop the game with some like minded people so fork away!*

should i take this as an example of good code?
*probably not in it's present state. I'm still trying to get my head around es6 and until then i'll be producing es5 mostly but i'm keen to make the transition fully from es5 to es6 so any help refactoring this codebase to be more "correct" would be great provided you can explain why it is better*

who made the artwork?
*me mostly in illustrator. Please bare this in mind if you are planning on using this game as a basis for your new game as well as the licencing metioned below.*


## First steps

Run the game with `yarn start` (or `npm start` if you prefer npm).


## Development

The following package scripts are also available to manage the project:

>   **HINT**: If you prefer npm, run these scripts with `npm run` instead.

```sh
yarn clean     # Manually deletes previous distribution files.
yarn dist      # Prepares the game for distribution.
yarn format    # Uses ESLint to format and remove lint issues.
yarn lint      # Checks scripts for lint issues using ESLint.
```
